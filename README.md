# TriviaGame

This game was a labor of inches. Every time I thought I had something figured or in the bag, I was sorely disapointed. It is amazing how each little snippet of code interacts with seemingly endless other bits and bobs. A solid concept is key for anything to function at all, and one mustn't be afraid to recode or delete entire sections to get a program running. At least, that's what I feel I learned when doing this project. 

The game should be fairly intuituive. It is a simple trivia quiz. The user has a set amount of time to answer a question, or the quiz moves on and the user gets the question wrong. 

The game lets the user know if they got the question right or wrong immediately after selecting a button. It also tallies the total percentage correct and informs the user at the conclusion of the quiz. 

Almost the entirtly of the HTML has been dynamically added to the DOM using jQuery.
